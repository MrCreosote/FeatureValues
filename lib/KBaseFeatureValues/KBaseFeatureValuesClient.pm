=head1 NAME

KBaseFeatureValues::KBaseFeatureValuesClient

=head1 DESCRIPTION


The KBaseFeatureValues set of data types and service provides a mechanism for
representing numeric values associated with genome features and conditions, together
with some basic operations on this data.  Essentially, the data is stored as a simple
2D matrix of floating point numbers.  Currently, this is exposed as support for
expression data and single gene knockout fitness data.  (Fitness data being growth
rate relative to WT growth with the specified single gene knockout in a specified
condition).

The operations supported on this data is simple clustering of genes and clustering 
related tools.

=head2 ItemStat

=over 4



=item Description

Statistics for a given item in a collection (defined by index) , calculated on the associated vector of values. 
Typical example is 2D matrix: item is a given row, and correposnding values from all columns is an associated vector.   
            
            In relation to ExpressionMatrix we can think about a gene (defined by row index in Float2DMatrix) and a vector of expression 
            values across all (or a subset of) conditions. In this case, index_for - index of a row representing a gene in the Float2DMatrix,  
            indeces_on - indeces of columns represnting a set of conditions on which we want to calculate statistics. 
             
            index_for - index of the item in a collection FOR which all statitics is collected
            indeces_on - indeces of items in the associated vector ON which the statistics is calculated
            size - number of elements in the associated vector
            avg - mean value for a given item across all elements in the associated vector 
            min - min value for a given item across all elements in the associated vector 
            max - max value for a given item across all elements in the associated vector 
            std - std value for a given item across all elements in the associated vector 
            missing_values - number of missing values for a given item across all elements in the associated vector

=head2 ItemSetStat

=item Description

Same as ItemStat, but for a set of Items. Actually it can be modeled as a list<ItemStat>, but this way we can optimize data transfer in two ways:
1. In parameters we can specify that we need a subset of properties, e.g. only "avgs". 
2. No field names in json (avg, min, max, etc) for each element in the list


            indeces_for - indeces of items in a collection FOR which all statitics is collected
            indeces_on - indeces of items in the associated vector ON which the statistics is calculated
            size - number of elements defined by indeces_on (expected to be the same for all items defined by indeces_for)
            avgs - mean values for each item defined by indeces_for across all elements defined by indeces_on 
            mins - min values for each item defined by indeces_for across all elements defined by indeces_on 
            maxs - max values for each item defined by indeces_for across all elements defined by indeces_on
