parameters :
    input_expression_matrix:
        ui-name : |
            ExpressionMatrix
        short-hint : |
            Select the ExpressionMatrix to use for estimating value of K.

    output_estimated_k :
        ui-name : |
            Estimated Number of Clusters
        short-hint : |
            Provide a name for estimated number of clusters output using only alphanymeric characters and underscores.

    min_k :
        ui-name : Minimum Number of Clusters
        short-hint : The smallest number of clusters for estimating potential values of K.

    max_k :
        ui-name : Maximum Number of Clusters
        short-hint : The largest number of clusters for estimating potential values of K.

    criterion :
        ui-name : Criterion
        short-hint : Criterion for calculating the average silhouette width. Select "asw" to calculate using the average silhouette width given out by the pam/clara. Select "multiasw" to use the silhouette width computed by distcritmulti (recommended for large data sets when usepam is not selected). Select "ch"  to use the Calinski-Harabasz index for estimating the number of clusters.

    usepam:
        ui-name : Use pam
        short-hint : If checked, Partitioning Around Medoids (pam) is used. Otherwise Clustering Large Applications (clara) is used. Clara is recommended for large datasets that contain over 2000 observations.

    alpha:
        ui-name : Alpha
        short-hint : Tuning constant used for the Duda-Hart test for whether or not a data set should be split into two clusters. Provide a numeric value between 0 and 1 to set the significance level (recommended to be small if this is used for estimating the number of clusters).

    diss:
        ui-name : Dissimilarity Matrix
        short-hint : If checked, data will be considered as a dissimilarity matrix. This means that the potential number of clusters will be larger than one. If not checked, the data will be considered as a matrix of observations by variables.

    random_seed :
        ui-name : Random Seed
        short-hint : Seed value used by the K-means algorithm. If left empty, a random seed value is generated. Setting the seed to a specific value is required to generate the same results every time.

    <p>This App generates reasonable numbers of clusters (K) for use in the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/KBaseFeatureValues/expression_toolkit_cluster_k_means/release”>Cluster Expression Data - K-Means</a> App. Reasonable values of K are computed by minimizing both the number of clusters (K) and the average variance between the clusters. Begin by selecting or importing an expression dataset to analyze using the <i>Add Data</i> button. Next, provide a name for the output estimate, a valid number for the maximum number of clusters, and select a criterion for running estimate K. Run this App to generate a graph with peaks that represent reasonable values for K calculated by the algorithm.</p>

    <p>The input is a .tsv file with "gene-id" listed in the A1 cell, the gene IDs listed in the A column, the sample/conditions identifiers in the first row, and the expression values that correspond to the gene-ids and sample throughout. For a comprehensive guide to formatting your expression data for import into KBase, see the <a href="http://kbase.us/data-upload-download-guide/expression-matrix/">Data Upload/Download Guide</a>.</p>

    <p>This App is based on the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/fpc/docs/pamk">fpc package for R</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This App is one of the steps in the <a href= "http://kbase.us/expression-analysis/">Transcriptomics and Expression Analysis Workflow</a> in KBase, however, it can also be run as a standalone.</p>

    <p><strong>Team members who developed & deployed algorithm in KBase:</strong> Paramvir Dehal, Roman Sutormin, Michael Sneddon, Srividya Ramakrishnan, Pavel Novichkov, Keith Keller. For questions, please <a href="http://kbase.us/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</p>
