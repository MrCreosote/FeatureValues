    input_data:
        ui-name : |
            Input Hierarchical Clusters
        short-hint : |
            Select the hierarchical clusters to reconstruct with new tree height cutoff.

    feature_height_cutoff:
        ui-name : |
            Tree Height Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            The percentage of tree height where branches are cut. Subgroups that join at a distance below this value are put in the same cluster.

    out_clusterset_id :
        ui-name : |
            Output Hierarchical Clusters
        short-hint : |
            Provide a name for the reconstructed set of hierarchical clusters.


description : |
    <p>This App produces new hierarchical clusters (also referred to as a dendrogram or cluster tree) from existing ones by applying a new cutoff value for cutting the branches and then reconstructing the set of clusters.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This App expects a cluster set generated by the hierarchical clustering algorithm and <u>will not</u> run successfully on clusters generated by any other approach, such as K-means or WGCNA.</p>

    <p>This method is based on the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/cutree.html">cutree</a> method from the R stats package.</p>
