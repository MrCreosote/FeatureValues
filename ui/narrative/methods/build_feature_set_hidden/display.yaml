    Feature Sets are useful for grouping a set of Features and performing some operation on that
    set of Features.  For instance, instead of specifying all the Features in a list for each method,
    you can use this method to build a single Feature Set, and pass this in as input for other
    methods.  Feature Sets are also sharable, so it allows you to call out or comment on specific
    Features in your Narrative.
