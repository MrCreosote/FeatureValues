            Input Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select the ExpressionMatrix for which to impute the missing values.

    out_matrix_id :
        ui-name : |
            Output Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for the imputed ExpressionMatrix (optional). If left blank, the original input ExpressMatrix will be overwritten with a new object containing the original data and the missing values replaced with imputed values.
        long-hint  : |
            If left blank, the input Expression Matix will be overwritten with the newly imputed values.


description : |
    <p>This App imputes the missing values of features for all of the samples or conditions contained within an ExpressionMatrix. The missing values in each row are imputed by replacing them with the mean of all other values in that specific row.</p>

    <p>The input is a .tsv file with "gene-id" listed in the top left cell, the gene IDs listed in the first column, the sample/conditions identifiers in the first row, and the expression values that correspond to the gene IDs and sample throughout. To ensure this App works properly, the empty value cells in the ExpressionMatrix <b>MUST BE</b> populated with “NA” (meaning “Not Assigned”). <b>Empty values, white space, or ‘NaN’ will result in an error.</b> For a comprehensive guide to formatting your expression data for import into KBase, see the <a href="http://kbase.us/data-upload-download-guide/expression-matrix/">Data Upload/Download Guide</a>.</p>
